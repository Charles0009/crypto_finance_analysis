__It is decomposed into multiple parts:__

1. APIs call to service provider 
2. Financial analysis 
3. Word processing for REDDIT and Twitter 


# FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A useful repository of financial indicators. They are isolated for the moment withe the hope to combine them to give a unified indicator on stock market analysis.


# WORD PROCESSING 
Word processing using REDDIT and Twitter with standardisation of language, sentiment analysis and word recognition patterns. 



## Mentions to used project
